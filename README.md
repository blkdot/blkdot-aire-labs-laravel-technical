# What I have done?

- I have implemented a page from figma design.
- I have implemented fully responsive.
- I didn't use any third party libraries such as Bootstrap, Tailwindcss.
- And also used component-based design.
- I have used helper function (get_accent_pos) to design accent effect.
- I have also used seeder to build DB.
- Also I have used lots of artisan commands.
